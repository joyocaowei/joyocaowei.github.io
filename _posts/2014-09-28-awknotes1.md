#### awk基本使用方式
- `awk '条件类型1{动作1}条件类型2{动作2}...' filename`

- `awk -f progfile optional list of input files`
>If the program is long, however, it is more convenient to put it into a separate file, say progfile, and type the command line

For example, give file seq

```bash
# seq - print sequences of integers
# input: arguments q, p q, or p q r; q >= p; r > 0
# output: integers 1 to q, p to q, or p to q in steps of r
BEGIN {
	if (ARGC == 2)
		for (i = 1; i <= ARGV[1]; i++)
			print i
	else if (ARGC == 3)
		for (i = ARGV[1]; i <= ARGV[2]; i++)
			print i
	else if (ARGC == 4)
		for (i = ARGV[1]; i <= ARGV[2]; i += ARGV[3])
			print i
}
```

`awk -f seq 10`
`awk -f seq 1 10`
`awk -f seq 1 10 1`
>all generate the integers one through ten.

#### Awk的一些常用变量
>`NF` 表示字段数量，在执行过程中相当于当前行的字段数
`NR` 表示记录数量，在执行过程中相当于当前行号
`FS` 分隔字符，默认是空格键
`$0` 当前行的文本内容
`$1` 当前行第一个字段的内容（默认以空格分隔字段）

#### COMPARISON OPERATORS

|OPERATOR | MEANING
|:-------:| :-------
|<        | less than
|<=       | less than or equal to
|==       | equal to
|!=       | not equal to
|>=       | greater than or equal to
|>        | greater than
|~        | matched by
|!~       | not matched by

#### Summary of Patterns

- BEGIN { statements }
>The statements are executed once before any input has been read.

- END { statements }
>The statements are executed once after all input has been read.

- expression { statements }
>The statements are executed at each input line where the expression is true, that is,
nonzero or nonnull.

- /regular expression/ { statements }
>The statements are executed at each input line that contains a string matched by the regular expression.
The regular expression metacharacters are:`\` `^` `$` `.` `[]` `|` `()` `*` `+` `?`
>
>alternation: `A|B` matches A or B.
concatenation: `AB` matches A immediately followed by B.
closure: `A*` matches zero or more A's.
positive closure: `A+` matches one or more A's.
zero or one: `A?` matches the null string or A.
parentheses: `(r)` matches the same strings as r does.
`.`: which matches any single character.
a character class: `[ABC]` matches any of the characters A, B, or C.


- compound pattern { statements }
>A compound pattern combines expressions with && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT), and
parentheses; the statements are executed at each input line where the compound
pattern is true.

- pattern1 , pattern2 { statements }
>A range pattern matches each input line from a line matched by pattern 1 to the next
line matched by pattern 2, inclusive; the statements are executed at each matching
line.

BEGIN and END do not combine with other patterns. A range pattern cannot be part of
any other pattern. BEGIN and END are the only patterns that require an action.
>If `{ statements }` is omitted, default print $0.

#### String Match Patterns
- **/regexpr/**
Matches when the current input line contains a substring matched by regexpr.

-  **expression ~ /regexpr/**
Matches if the string value of expression contains a substring matched by regexpr.

- **expression !~ /regexpr/**
Matches if the string value of expression does not contain a substring matched by regexpr.

- **Some Examples**
 - `awk '$1 !~ /^[0-9]+/' countries`
 >文件countries的第一个字段不能以数字开始

 - `/^[0-9]+$/`
 >matches any input line that consists of only digits

 - `/^[0-9][0-9][0-9]$/`
 >exactly three digits

 - `/^(\+|-)?[0-9]+\.?[0-9]+$/`
 >a decimal number with an optional sign and optional fraction

 - `/^[+-]?[0-9]+[.]?[0-9]+$/`
 >also a decimal number with an optional sign and optional fraction
 for example: `echo "-12.5" | awk '/^[+-]?[0-9]+[.]?[0-9]+$/'` will get -12.5

 - `/^[+-]?([0-9]+[.]?[0-9]*|[.][0-9]+)([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?$/`
 >a floating point number with optional sign and optional exponent

 - `/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*$`
 >a letter followed by any letters or digits (e.g., awk variable name)

 - `/^[A-Za-z]$|^[A-Za-z][0-9]$/`
 >a letter or a letter followed by a digit (e.g., variable name in Basic)

 - `/^[A-Za-z][0-9]?$/`
 >also a letter or a letter followed by a digit

#### A Handful of Useful "One-liners" - from The AWK Programming Language

- Print the total number of input lines:
`END { print NR }`

- Print the tenth input line:
`NR == 10`

- Print the last field of every input line:
`{ print $NF }`

- Print the last field of the last input line:
>{ field = $NF}
 END { print field }

- Print every input line with more than four fields:
`NF > 4`

- Print every input line in which the last field is more than 4:
`$NF > 4`

- Print the total number of fields in all input lines:
>{ nf = nf + NF }
END { print nf }

- Print the total number of lines that contain Beth:
>/Beth/ { nlines = nlines + 1 }
END { print nlines }

- Print the largest first field and the line that contains it (assumes some $1 is positive):
>$1 > max { max = $1; maxline = $0 }
END { print max, maxline }

- Print every line that has at least one field:
`NF > 0`

- Print every line longer than 80 characters:
`length($0) > 80`

- Print the number of fields in every line followed by the line itself:
`{ print NF, $0 }`

- Print the first two fields, in opposite order, of every line:
`{ print $2, $1 }`

- Exchange the first two fields of every line and then print the line:
`{ temp = $1; $1 = $2; $2 = temp; print }`

- Print every line with the first field replaced by the line number:
`{ $1 = NR; print }`

- Print every line after erasing the second field:
`{ $2 = ""; print }`

- Print in reverse order the fields of every line:
>for (i = NF; i > 0; i = i - 1) printf("%s ", $i)
printf ( "\n" )

- Print the sums of the fields of every line:
>{ sum= 0
  for (i = 1; i <= NF; i = i + 1) sum = sum + $i
  print sum
}

- Add up all fields in all lines and print the sum:
>{ for (i = 1; i <= NF; i = i + 1) sum = sum + Si }
END { print sum }

- Print every line after replacing each field by its absolute value:
>{ for (i = 1; i <= NF; i = i + 1) if ($i < 0) Si = -$i
  print
}
